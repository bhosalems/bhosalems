# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahesh, some endearingly often call me Maahi, much like the mahi-mahi fish â€” but thankfully, I'm better at coding than swimming! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Artificial Intelligence Innovation Laboratory (A2IL)](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/research/organizations/innovation-lab.html) at the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). 

Much like our brain relies on a perceptual system to interpret visual stimuli, my work revolves around developing a similar perceptual framework for neural networks, enabling them to 'see' and understand the world around them. I am working on the following areas of research at the moment -
1. Generative modeling for Biomedical images and videos such as - MRI, CT, X-ray, Histopathology, and Endoscopy videos.
2. Video understanding for Action spotting and reidentification.
3. Chart and document analysis
### Blog

I love to share my knowledge and insights about AI, machine learning, and my PhD journey. Check out my blog at [bhosalems.github.io](https://bhosalems.github.io).

### Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaborating on projects, discussing research ideas, or just chatting about the latest in tech and/or how your day has been. Feel free to connect with me on X[https://twitter.com/ms_bhosale] or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maheshsbhosale/)
