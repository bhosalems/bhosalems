Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahesh, some endearingly often call me Maahi, much like the mahi-mahi fish but thankfully, I'm better at coding than swimming! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Artificial Intelligence Innovation Laboratory (A2IL)](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/research/organizations/innovation-lab.html) in the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). 

Much like our brain relies on a perceptual system to interpret visual stimuli, my work revolves around developing a similar perceptual framework for neural networks, enabling them to 'see' and understand the world around them. I am working on the following areas of research at the moment -
1. Generative modeling for images and videos.
2. Hallucinations in Diffusion Models.
3. MultiModal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
4. Chart and Document Analysis.
### Blog

I love to share my knowledge and insights about AI, machine learning, and my PhD journey. Check out my blog at [bhosalems.github.io](https://bhosalems.github.io).
